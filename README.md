## 📌 Overview

FinSight AI is an end-to-end Financial Intelligence System that combines semantic retrieval, vector databases, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract actionable insights from quarterly earnings reports and earnings press releases.

The system enables users to ask natural language questions about company performance, revenue trends, growth drivers, and quarterly results. FinSight retrieves relevant financial context using semantic search and generates grounded responses through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

### Key Achievements

* Built a Financial Intelligence System using RAG over quarterly earnings reports and press releases.
* Implemented semantic retrieval using ChromaDB and Sentence Transformers.
* Supports Financial Q&A, Comparison, Reasoning, Summarization, and Trend Analysis.
* Developed automated revenue extraction supporting both USD and INR reporting formats.
* Achieved **95.6% evaluation accuracy** on a custom financial benchmark.
* Deployed using Streamlit on Hugging Face Spaces.
